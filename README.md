# Mimir

> [!Warning]
> This project is a first draft. It is entirely likely that I will start over from scratch several times as Mimir develops.

Mimir is an opinionated note-taking and writing application designed to seamlessly merge the processes of learning and creating. By integrating writing, from small ideas to academic papers, into a web of personal notes and references, Mimir empowers you to understand how everything you think about is connected.

This application is inspired by knowledge management systems like Obsidian and Zettelkasten, but extends them by enabling the user to link their notes to their long form writing.
